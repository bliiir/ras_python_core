# Fundamentals Exercise 1: CLI

Perform the following tasks using the CLI and copy and paste the commands and results below.

- Navigate to your home directory

```
cd ~
```

- Create a new directory called CodingNomads. We will use this folder to house materials for the course.

```
mkdir CodingNomads
```

- Move into the CodingNomads folder
```
cd Codingnomads
```

- Create new folder cli_testing
```
mkdir cli_testing
```

- Inside of folder cli_testing,
    a. print the directory path

    ```
    pwd
    ```

    b. create 3 new .txt files all with different names (file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt)

    ```
    touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
    ```

    c. list the contents of the folder

    ```
    ls
    ```

    d. rename one of the files

    ```
    mv file1.txt file4.txt
    ```

- Inside of folder cli_testing, create a new folder

```
mkdir new
```

- Copy a file from cli_testing to the new folder
```
cp file4.txt new
```

- Move a different file from cli_testing to the new folder
```
mv file3.txt new
```
- Demonstrate removing:
    a. A file
    ```
    rm file2.txt
    ```

    b. A folder
    ```
    rm -R new
    ```

## vim
    a. Use $ vim to write some text inside a file
    ```
    vim
    some text inside a file
    :wq some.txt
    ```
    b. Use $ cat print contents of file
    ```
    cat some.txt
    ```

    c. Use $ grep to search for a word inside file
    ```
    grep inside some.txt
    ```

## explore advanced CLI
- What is the difference between the two commands > and >>?

A: One replaces the content of the target file and the other appends to it

- Append the text "how?!" of hello.txt to my_file.txt
```
cat hello.txt >> my_file.txt
```

- Overwrite the content of my_file.txt with "tell me"
echo "tell me" > my_file.txt
