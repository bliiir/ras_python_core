1 - What is a boolean expression?
An expression that evaluates to either True or False

2 - What are relational operators used for?
As part of boolean expressions to determine if a condition is true - for example: Is 5 bigger than 4 would be expressed 5>4 with the > as the relational operator

3 - What is the difference between == and = ?
== is a relational operator and = is an assignment operator

4 - What are the three logical operators?
and, or, not

5 - What do relational and logical operators evaluate to?
True or False

6 - What is the if statement used for?
Conditional execution

7 - What is an if/else statement used for?
Conditional with alternative execution. Test one condition and if that is False execute the alternative statement.

8 - What is a chained conditional? How do you chain conditionals?
When you chain conditions together to accomodate more than one or two possibilities
You use "elif" or "else if"

9 - What is a nested conditional?
When conditional statements are nested under eachother:
if x == y:
    if y == z:
        print("foo")
    else:
        print("bar")
elif x>y:
    print("brrr")
else:
    print("manamanah")

10 - Is there a limit to how many conditional statements you can nest?
No

11 - What is a while loop?
A command used to iterate through a set of statements until the condition the while loops is conditioned on evaluates to false or the loop is broken with a break statement

12 - What is a for loop? How is it different than a while loop?
A for loop iterates through a range or a list. A while loop executes WHILE it's condition evaluates to True.

11 - What does the break statement do?
Breaks out of while, try and except conditionals

12 - Is there a limit to how many loops you can nest?
Not conceptually, but the specific program might hit memory boundaries and halt and there has to be at least one.
